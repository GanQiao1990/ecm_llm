## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- **No COM ports available**:
  - Make sure the ESP32 is properly connected
  - Install the correct USB drivers for your ESP32
  - Try unplugging and reconnecting the USB cable
  - On Linux, you may need permissions to access serial ports: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` (then logout/login)

- **Connection fails**:
  - Check that the baud rate matches (default: 57600)
  - Ensure no other program is using the serial port
  - Try different timeout values (the improved version automatically tries multiple timeouts)
  - Verify the ESP32 is sending data in the expected format

- **No data received**:
  - Check the ESP32 serial monitor to verify it's sending data
  - Ensure the data format matches: `DATA,timestamp,ecg_value,resp_value,heart_rate,status`
  - Try different serial port settings (the improved version tries multiple configurations)
  - Check for loose connections or cable issues

- **Data parsing errors**:
  - Verify the ESP32 is sending properly formatted CSV data
  - Check for missing commas or extra characters in the data stream
  - Enable debug logging to see raw data being received

### Testing Connection

Use the included test script to debug connection issues:

```bash
python test_connection.py
```

### AI Diagnosis Testing

Test the diagnosis system without hardware:

```bash
python test_diagnosis.py
```

This will run sample ECG patterns through the AI diagnosis system and show results.

### AI Diagnosis Issues

- **"API Setup Failed"**:
  - Verify your API key is correct and active
  - Check internet connection
  - Ensure API URL is correct: https://deepresearch2agi.cn/
  - Try testing with: `python test_diagnosis.py`

- **"Not enough ECG data for analysis"**:
  - Wait for at least 4 seconds of ECG data
  - Check that ECG device is connected and sending data
  - Verify data is being received (check ECG statistics tab)

- **Diagnosis takes too long or fails**:
  - Check internet connection stability
  - Verify API rate limits haven't been exceeded
  - Try again after a few minutes
  - Check diagnosis error messages in the results panel

- **Poor diagnosis quality**:
  - Ensure good ECG signal quality (minimal noise)
  - Provide patient information for better context
  - Use longer ECG segments (10+ seconds recommended)
  - Check that electrodes are properly connected

### Performance Issues

- **Slow or choppy display**:
  - The buffer size has been increased to 2000 points (8 seconds of data)
  - Try reducing the plot update rate if your system is slow
  - Close other applications that might be using system resources
  - Disable auto-diagnosis if system is slow

- **High CPU usage**:
  - The improved version uses more efficient data handling
  - Consider reducing the sample rate on the ESP32 side if needed
  - Disable auto-diagnosis mode if not needed
  - Close unused tabs in the diagnosis panel

### Data Format Issues

- **"Invalid data format" errors**:
  - This has been fixed in v2.0! The system now automatically detects simple numeric data format
  - Supported formats: single values per line (like -7, -6, -5) or CSV format
  - Use `python analyze_data_format.py` to check your data format

### API Configuration

- **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file with your API configuration:
  ```bash
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  GEMINI_API_URL=https://deepresearch2agi.cn/
  ```

- **API Key Management**: 
  - Never commit API keys to version control
  - Use environment variables or the GUI configuration
  - Keep your API key secure and don't share it

### Performance Issues

- **Slow or choppy display**:
  - The buffer size has been increased to 2000 points (8 seconds of data)
  - Try reducing the plot update rate if your system is slow
  - Close other applications that might be using system resources

- **High CPU usage**:
  - The improved version uses more efficient data handling
  - Consider reducing the sample rate on the ESP32 side if needed

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging, modify the source code to increase verbosity or add print statements to track data flow.

## Improvements in This Version

- **Enhanced connection handling**: Multiple timeout attempts and better error recovery
- **Thread-safe data processing**: Uses Qt signals for safe GUI updates
- **Better error messages**: More descriptive error dialogs and status updates
- **Improved data validation**: Validates data format before processing
- **Larger data buffer**: 8 seconds of data display instead of 5
- **Connection testing**: Included test script for debugging
- **Automatic reconnection attempts**: Basic framework for reconnection (can be extended)
- **Better resource management**: Proper cleanup of threads and file handles

## Data Format

The ECG receiver now supports multiple data formats:

### Standard Format (Recommended)
```
DATA,timestamp,ecg_value,resp_value,heart_rate,status
```
Example: `DATA,1234567890,1024,512,75,OK`

### Simple Numeric Format (Auto-detected)
If your ESP32 sends simple numeric values (like in your case), the receiver will automatically detect and process them:
```
-7
-6
-5
1024
1050
```

### Multiple Values Per Line
Space or comma separated values:
```
1024 512 75
1050,520,76
```

## Fixing "Invalid data format" Errors

If you see "Invalid data format" errors like:
```
Invalid data format: -7...
Invalid data format: -6...
```

**This has been fixed!** The improved version now:
1. ✓ Automatically detects simple numeric data format
2. ✓ Processes single values per line (like -7, -6, -5)
3. ✓ Handles both positive and negative values
4. ✓ Works with integer and decimal values

### Testing Your Data Format

Use the data format analyzer to see what your ESP32 is sending:
```bash
python analyze_data_format.py
```

This will:
- Connect to your ESP32 (COM7 or first available port)
- Show you exactly what data format is being sent
- Analyze the data rate and format
- Provide specific recommendations
